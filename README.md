his project on terrorism data analysis aims to explore global patterns of terrorist activities with a focus on understanding casualties and fatalities across different years, terrorist groups, cities, and countries. Using data from sources like the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), it will analyze trends in terrorist incidents over time, revealing escalation or reduction in violence year-by-year. The project will delve into group-wise analysis to examine how specific terrorist organizations have impacted various regions, identifying high-risk zones. A city and country-level analysis will highlight geographical hotspots and major urban areas affected by terrorism. By leveraging Python or R for data processing and visualization, along with GIS mapping tools, this project will present a detailed, visual summary of trends and high-risk areas. It will culminate in actionable insights for policymakers, supporting strategic efforts to address security risks and prevent future attacks.
